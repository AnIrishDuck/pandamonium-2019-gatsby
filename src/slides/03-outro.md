# Conclusion

<!--
So after, working with Gatsby a bunch, what do I think?

## V1 -> V2

<!--
My experience overall has been very positive. It has not all been sunshine and
rainbows.

Part of this is inevitable for a new product moving quickly. Gatsby recently
released a major new v2 with some big breaks to backwards compatibility.

The biggest one that bit me the hardest was the removal of layouts. I think this
is a positive change. The old layout magic was very against the spirit of
React's modular components. But I had to understand that magic to fix these
slides.

To be fair, it was easy to find great documentation about this change, the
migration path, and the justification. This has been the norm with Gatsby. The
documentation is amazingly good for something this bleeding edge.

## Pain

- https://github.com/fabe/gatsby-starter-deck/pull/12

<!--

That said, I had to open one pull requests for the community "deck
starter" to get it in line with v2 of Gatsby.

Gatsby already has a vibrant and growing community, which is a good thing. The
downside is the creator of this starter was a bit new to Gatsby and did some
things that the documentation explicitly recommends against ... in v2.

I'm still really hopeful for the future though. Gatsby and similar approaches
give us the capability to build "isomorphic" sites. I think that trend is
coming.

## Hope

<!--
TODO: image

Canvas today is a very dynamic application. With inst-ui being built on react,
most rendering occurs in the browser.

Things like Gatsby give me hope. If Gatsby or something like it could
be used to constantly optimize first loads with little development effort ...

I think that'd be a pretty amazing thing.

So that's Gatsby. It'll save you time. It could make our products better.

Thanks everyone for your ears, eyes, and time.
